Playing the blame game
----------------------

If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:

> I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.

Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:

> I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
> could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
> the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
> come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...
>
> I don't want to sound like
> I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
> just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
> as I should be in coming up with one.

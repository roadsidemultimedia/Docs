# Options #

PageLines DMS provides users with a number of global settings, allowing them to change their site's layout, add social integration, control colors, styles and more.

## Site Images ##

The **Site Images** panel allows you to upload custom images to be used on your site, such as favicon, login page and mobile touch image. You can either choose to upload an image from your computer or enter the full URL location of your custom image.

The favicon image is a good way to brand your site and increase it’s prominence in your visitor’s bookmark menu and tabs. **Must be .png or .ico file - 32px by 32px**

#### Login Page Image ####

This image will be used on your Wordpress login page and is great for client websites. Use an image that is approximately **80px in height**.

#### Mobile Touch Image ####

The mobile touch image is visible when your users add your site as a webclip in Apple Iphone and Touch Products. **It is an image approximately 57px by 57px in either .jpg, .gif or .png format.**

## Layout & Nav ##

The **Layouts & Nav** panel provides options for configuring the layout and navigation of your site.

#### Display Mode ####

## Typography ##

The **Typography** panel provides the ability to change font size, weight as well as the default font family used on your website.

#### Select Font ####

The Select font dropdown menu allows you to choose from many popular web fonts. The whole Google web fonts library can be included by installing our [Google Web fonts plugin](http://www.pagelines.com/store/plugins/pagelines-googlefonts/), available from the **Store** tab in the DMS toolbar.

#### Content Base & Site Text Colors ####

The **Content base** color is used as your background and as a basis for calculating contrast values in elements such as hover effects, etc. Use it as your default background color and refine using custom CSS/LESS or a child theme.

The Site text colors setting allows you to configure the basic text colors for your site.

#### Background Image Settings ####

If you would prefer to set the background to something other than a single color; you can upload your own image.

2. Click **Upload Image**.
3. Once uploaded, a preview of your image will be visible.

**Fit image to page?**

If you use this option the image will be fit **responsively** to the background of your page. This means the settings below will have no effect.

* **Vertical Position in Percent** allows you to move the image down the page
* **Horizontal Position in Percent** allows you to move the image to right of the page

## Resets ##

The **Resets** panel should be used with extreme caution. There are two reset options available on that panel. Use of these resets will restore global settings, including resetting current page settings.  You will be removing, on a global basis, all changes you've made to the site via settings.  

We recommend taking extra care and proceeding slowly, when using the Reset options.

Use this button to reset **all global settings** to their default state. Once you've completed this action, you may want to publish these changes to your live site.

#### Reset Current Page Settings ####

Use this button to reset all settings on the **current page** back to their default state. Once you've completed this action, you may want to publish these changes to your live site.

#### Clear all CSS/LESS cached data. ####

Use this button to purge the stored LESS/CSS data. This will also clear cached pages if wp-super-cache or w3-total-cache are detected.
